            <h2>Our Organization</h2>
            <p>We are a team of dedicated individuals committed to enhancing after-school programs for children facing homelessness and mental illness. Our work involves analyzing data from various sources using tools such as Joint Application Development (JAD) sessions and surveys with a funnel structure. These methods allow us to gather insights and develop strategies to improve the programs provided by A Community of Friends (ACOF), a nonprofit organization focused on providing comprehensive support to individuals experiencing chronic homelessness and mental illness.</p>
