## 📌 Project Description
This project focuses on improving after-school programs for children experiencing homelessness and mental illness through systems analysis, stakeholder interviews, survey design, and trauma-informed program planning.  

A complete HTML/CSS website was developed to present the program, showcase services, and support community engagement, built using custom layouts, navigation components, and responsive styling.

## 📐 Methodology
This project used a structured Systems Analysis & Design workflow.
Stakeholder interviews with Community of Friends case specialists informed a trauma-informed needs assessment. JAD sessions were proposed to involve families, staff, and children in co-designing program improvements. Agile iteration cycles were applied to refine program features, survey instruments, and website content.  

The website was designed with custom HTML structure, CSS-based styling, navigation menus, and community resource sections. It serves as the final deliverable presenting program information, volunteer pathways, and organizational messaging.
